        <br><br><div class="block"><h2>atlast, his career</h2>
        <p>Rathee is mainly known for his political videos, which mainly contain fact-checking and explanatory content. According to ThePrint, Rathee was one of the first Indian users to use YouTube as a political platform, having started uploading travel videos in 2013 but by the end of 2013 he started shifting his prospective towards political and social topics.</p><br>

            <p>Rathee has addressed various topics in his videos, including the 2022 Muhammad remarks controversy, 2022 Morbi bridge collapse, 2019 Pulwama attack, 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest and 2023 Manipur violence. Alongside his serious content, Rathee launched Pee News, a satirical "fake news" segment. Additionally, from 2017 until early 2020, Rathee wrote opinion columns for ThePrint.</p><br>
            
            <p>In July 2020, Rathee began another YouTube channel called Dhruv Rathee Vlogs, where he shares his international travel vlogs. In addition to his travel vlogs, Rathee hosts various shows, including DW Travel of Deutsche Welle and Decode with Dhruv of Netflix India. He also hosts a podcast on Spotify called Maha Bharat with Dhruv Rathee. In 2020, Rathee released a video discussing the controversy and criticizing Kangana Ranaut's statements. In response, Ranaut threatened legal action against Rathee for "lying about BMC notice for my house."</p><br>
            
            <p>As of February 2022, Dhruv Rathee began a shorts channel to share 30-seconds fact videos. This channel offers a quick and accessible way for viewers to engage with the information Rathee presents. In September 2022, he faced controversy when a video he posted about the political crisis in Pakistan was blocked by India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The ministry claimed that the video contained a distorted map of India, in which parts of Kashmir were depicted as part of Pakistan or "disputed". In March 2023, he also faced copyright charges from Dabur on his video titled "The dark-side of cold drinks". In an order, the Calcutta high court ordered social media platforms to remove the video.</p><br>
