        <br>
        <p class="para"> James Stephen "Jimmy" Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), more commonly known as MrBeast, is an American YouTuber. He is known for his fast-paced and high-production videos, which feature elaborate challenges and large giveaways. With over 210 million subscribers, he is the most-subscribed individual on the platform and the second-most-subscribed channel overall.

            Donaldson grew up in Greenville, North Carolina. He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13, under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers". He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views. His videos became increasingly grand and extravagant. Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself. Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)[20] and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy. He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.
            
            Donaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables; and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million;[25][26] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million. Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four times at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, Time named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people. He has ranked on the Forbes list for the highest paid YouTube creator in 2022[28] and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h2>let's begin from hi early life</h2>
        <p>James Stephen Donaldson was born on May 7, 1998 in Wichita, Kansas. He was mainly raised in Greenville, North Carolina. He moved often and was under the care of au pairs due to his parents working long hours and serving in the military. His parents divorced in 2007. In 2016, Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a small private evangelical Christian high school in the area. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out. After dropping out, Donaldson and his friends tried to analyze YouTube's recommendation algorithm and sought to deduce how to create viral videos. Donaldson recalled during this time, "There’s a five-year point in my life where I was just relentlessly, unhealthily obsessed with studying virality, studying the YouTube algorithm. I woke up. I would Uber Eats food. And then I would sit on my computer all day just studying shit nonstop with [other YouTubers]."</p>

        <p>2→Mr. Beast Started YouTube At Just 13 Years Old In February 2012
        </p><br>
        <p>3→ he has won streamy awards twice once in 2022 and once in 2023</p><br>
        <p>4 &rarr;Mr.Beast is an award-winning creator</p><br>
        <p>5 &rarr;Mr.Beast has had to deal with toxic workplace allegations</p>
        <br>
        <p>6 &rarr; Mr. Beast Didn’t Finish College To Focus On YouTube</p><br>
        <p>7 &rarr;Donaldson’s otherwise unremarkable workplace and living area are decorated with paintings of successful businessmen Steve Jobs and Elon Musk (including one of Musk, procured on Amazon, dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte). Donaldson adds of Musk, “I don’t endorse or look up to anything he does or how he handles people.” However, when it comes to business and growing wealth, there are certainly much worse people to admire. Elon Musk also recently joked that when he dies, he will give Mr. Beast ownership of Twitter.</p><br>
        <p>8&rarr;Donaldson claims he has no clear recollections of his early life. A lot of this, he says, is due to his natural business spirit. He believes himself to be a highly futuristic person. Let the past die. It has already transpired. In other words, I’m out to rule the future. Even though his mother keeps every piece of memorabilia from his old videos in a huge warehouse, he has never visited it.</p><br>
        <p>9&rarr;His Mom Didn’t Know He Was Making YouTube Videos
        </p><br>
        <p>10 &rarr;Donaldson’s first brand agreement came right after he hit 750,000 subscribers and moved into a modest house with his best friend, Chris Tyson. He didn’t blow the money on frivolous things but instead made a YouTube video in which he gave a homeless individual a check for $10,000.</p><br>
        <p>11 &rarr;Donaldson’s video budget has increased alongside his rapidly growing subscriber base. Most of today’s models have an astronomical production cost of $1 million or more, making just a tiny fraction of them worthwhile. Donalson’s “gaming” and “reacts” channels, which feature the lads and are produced cheaply, significantly subsidize the main channel. “I could be doing videos for less money,” Donaldson says. But I don’t feel like it. If I can go even further, I will.
        </p><br>
        <p>12 &rarr;After spending roughly $4 million recreating the Netflix series Squid Game (although without the excessive violence) and awarding the winner $456,000 during a grueling game of musical chairs in late 2021, Donaldson’s superhuman skill at conquering YouTube made headlines throughout the world. More than 225 million people have seen the video since it was uploaded.</p><br>

        <h2>atlast, his career</h2>
        <p><h3>Early viral attemps(212-2017)</h3><p>Donaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the name of "MrBeast6000".[38] His early content ranged from Let's Plays, mainly focused on Minecraft and Call of Duty: Black Ops II,[38] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[39] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[38]

            In 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his "Worst intros on YouTube" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.[38] By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[17][39] His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.[34]
            
            As his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends – Kris Tyson (formerly Chris Tyson), Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds and Jake Franklin – to contribute to his channel.[34] Franklin left the crew in 2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.[40][41][42]</p></p>
