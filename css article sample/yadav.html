        <h2>atlast, his career</h2>
        <p>Maini started uploading video game content to YouTube. When he was 14 years old, his brother gave him his
            first smartphone, which was a ZTE Blade. Maini decided to make a video about it, which "a lot of people
            watched it, and the video did much better than I expected". From there, he turned his attention to creating
            smartphone videos, which ultimately lead to the trajectory of his channel.

            When Maini was studying at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, he was on an economics track.
            During the course of his studies, he had an internship at Pricewaterhouse Coopers, an accounting firm in
            London. He considered these eight weeks "rather mundane and boring". When there, Maini would often complete
            his work "really quickly" and begin jotting down ideas for new YouTube videos to be recorded that evening.
            At the conclusion of his internship with Price Waterhouse, Maini was offered an entry-level job that made a
            salary of about £35,000 (about $46,000). However, he turned down the job and prioritized his career on
            YouTube.

            Maini initially focused on videos about smartphones, including smartphone reviews. However, as the channel's
            following expanded, he extended his video premises to covering laptops, cars, and even a vacuum cleaner. He
            has also made videos where he gives his opinions about topics such as manipulation of the media by tech
            companies and the metaverse. In 2015, Maini uploaded his first viral video which was a tutorial on creating
            a makeshift 3D hologram projector by crafting a pyramid composed of reflective material and placing it on a
            smartphone screen. The video received coverage from The Daily Dot and CNBC. The video is still his most
            viewed YouTube video.

            In May 2021, Maini signed with Night Media. In September 2022, Maini released a video claiming that Samsung
            phones may have problems with swelling batteries after he found that his Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Samsung
            Galaxy S6, and Samsung Galaxy S10 had all experienced the issue. Similar claims were corroborated in the
            video by YouTuber Marques Brownlee.</p>
